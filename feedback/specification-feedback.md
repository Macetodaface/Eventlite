Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded: e538f60ee03e31752ed4c48bef24dece2fd03771

### The product backlog (9/10)

* A spreadsheet-like format is easier to read for backlogs, rather than prose or bulleted lists.  You could also explore existing online tools for generating and tracking work on a project.

* Each student should have sole responsibility for some features on the overall project. It might be a good idea to have clear assignment of responsibility for each feature. 

* You should outline which features will be core to your final product, and which features are reach goals.

### Data models (10/10)

* Models seem generally complete and adequate.

### Wireframes or mock-ups (9/10)

* Wireframes seem like they are missing some user flow outlined in the backlog. It might be a good idea to make HTML templates for these soon!
