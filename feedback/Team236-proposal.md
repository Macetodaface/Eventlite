 * The difficult part of your project seems to be content generation and payment management - the web app you described is fairly simple, and probably not enough work for a 3-person group. A payment platform is not an easy problem to solve, and certainly not an interesting one. Try to think about what other application features you can add on the webste.

 * This project spec is a bit vague, and as of right now the project seems a bit too simple. You spend a lot of time talking about the benefits of using your app, but these are things that you probably can't guarantee in the real world/have nothing to do with the webapp (e.g. refunding 95% of ticket cost for cancellation might lose you a lot of money). For things to actually implement, you really only talked about sellers being able to make a posting, and then users being able to respond to the posting, which is quite similar to the functionality of Grumblr. I recommend brainstorming how to make this app different and stand out, and to do more than just allowing for posts to be made. You might want to take a look into some APIs like Google wallet to handle transactions.

 * It sounds like you have a lot of features that you want to implement. You should prioritize these features and make sure you have a high quality, cohesive app up and running before mooving on to the specifics (refunds - which is not very interesting, flash sales). P.s. you should have handed in a PDF file.
